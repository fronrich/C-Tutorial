C Help
  - C is a lot like java
  - replaced assembly
  - the semi-direct predecessor of java
  - In java
    - Code --> VM --> Machine
  - in C
    - code --> Machine
    - no such thing as exceptions
    - you can mess up easier than in java
      - doesn't care what your intent is
    - 1 error, segmentation fault
      - something you don't want
      - CPU (Rock that we tricked into thinking)
        - x86_64
          - assembly code with lots of instructions
        - registers (data storage areas)
          - general purpose registers
            - %rax %rcx %rdx %rbx
            - each register can store 64 bits of data
            - basic data types
              - char (8 bits [1 byte])
              - short (16 bits)
              - int (32 bits)
              - long (64 bits)
              - long long (? bits)
            - signed and unsigned data types
              - not difference in bits
              - signed: n-bit 2s complement integers
                - (-2^(k-1) -> 2^(k-1) - 1)
              - unsigned: treat entire bit string as a positive value
                - (0 -> 2^k - 1)
            - size_t: maximum possible size you can determine an array for
            -floating point
              - float (32)
              - double (64)
              - long double (?)
      - Cache
        - L1i, L1d, L2, L3
        - slower than registers, but really fast
      - RAM (Random access memory)
        - general purpose storage
        - programs swap data into RAM
        - Java has the garbage collector
        - C does not have the garbage collector
          - You have to think about the garbage
    - Unix used to be its own operating system
      - introduced the concept of memory segmentation
      - if a program takes up more space than allotted,
      the CPU throws a segmentation fault because programs
      shouldn't be able to take up the segmented space
      of other programs
        - security issues like viruses can segment into other space
    - Pointers:
      - references to addressees
