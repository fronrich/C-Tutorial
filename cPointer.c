// Pointer format
// Assume i is 7 and at address 0x00
// int *p = &i; pointer p (*p) is assigned address of i
// int v = *p; v is assigned the value at *p (which
// is the address of i)

// & - address of: (some int some double)
// if given variable i, &i is the adress of i
// pointers are nothing more than numbers
// representing the bytes in memory we want

// * - value at: (0x00 0xFF)
// the value at the a location in memory
// **p - pointer to a pointer
